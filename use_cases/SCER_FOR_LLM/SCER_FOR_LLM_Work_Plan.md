# SCER for LLM Work Plan

## Background and Motivation

Now that the SCER specification is fully developed, there's an apparent gap in its application, primarily due to the lack of use cases that demonstrate its utility. The recent rapid AI development reveals a critical need in the Generative AI (GAI) domain: a standardized method for evaluating and comparing the carbon efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). Therefore, the aim of SCER for LLM is to establish a framework that provides a relative or absolute rating of LLMs, focusing on their carbon efficiencies. This initiative responds to the growing demand for sustainable AI technologies that align with global efforts to reduce carbon footprints.

## Landscape Analysis and Research

### Energy Consumption by LLMs

Recent advancements and policy mandates on AI's energy needs underscore the importance of sustainable practices in AI development. An in-depth analysis of the current energy consumption trends by LLMs is essential. For a comprehensive overview, refer to the study at [NNLabs on Power Requirements of Large Language Models](https://www.nnlabs.org/power-requirements-of-large-language-models/).

*Todo: may need more comprehensive study and understanding of LLM specific energy, to establish the need to reduce carbon footprints by LLMs.*

### Energy Measuring Tools for LLMs

A critical examination of the existing tools designed to measure the energy consumption of LLMs reveals their strengths and weaknesses. A gap analysis will help identify the unmet needs in the current ecosystem.

*Todo: a more comprehensive study is needed for the measuring tools and their pros and cons.*

## SCER for LLM Overview

SCER for LLM proposes a standardized approach to measure and rate the carbon efficiency of LLMs. This initiative is positioned to bridge the identified gaps by providing a clear specification for evaluating LLMs' environmental impact. SCER aims to facilitate the adoption of more sustainable practices in the development and deployment of generative AI technologies.

## Goal and Vision of SCER for LLM

The primary goal of SCER for LLM is to promote transparency and accountability in the AI sector by standardizing the measurement of LLMs' carbon efficiencies. The vision encompasses a future where all stakeholders in the AI ecosystem, from developers to end-users, are empowered to make informed decisions based on the carbon efficiency ratings of LLMs. Ultimately, SCER for LLM seeks to encourage the development of more energy-efficient AI technologies, contributing to the global efforts to fight climate change.
