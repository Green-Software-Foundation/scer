This is a placeholder document for Software Carbon Efficiency Rating for Large Language Models (SCER for LLMs) Specification.

This specification is a use case for the SCER specification (the base specification). Based on the standard process defined in the SCER specification, the following components of the specification are defined to rate the software carbon efficiencies of LLMs:
- Software Categorization
- Benchmark definition (workload, method etc)
- Rating definition (range, algorithm, etc)
- Visualization and Labelling (on huggingface, or MLPerf-like)
