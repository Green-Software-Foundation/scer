## Objective
To establish a standardized methodology for measuring and comparing the carbon efficiency of software applications, ensuring consistent, reproducible results across different platforms and environments.

## Components:

### Hardware Specifications
+ Define a baseline hardware setup that includes processor type, memory capacity, storage type, and network configuration. This baseline should represent mid-tier, widely accessible hardware to ensure broad applicability. 
For cloud-based testing, specify a standard cloud instance type (e.g., AWS m5.large, Azure D4s_v3) with fixed resource allocation.

### Software Configuration
+ Operating System: Use a standardized, widely supported operating system (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) with minimal additional services running to reduce background noise in energy consumption measurements.
+ Middleware and Dependencies: Specify versions and configurations for any middleware or software dependencies, ensuring consistency across all test environments.

### Benchmark Workload Definition

+ Unit of Software Function (USF): Define the core functionality to be measured (e.g., number of API requests processed, number of data sets analyzed).
+ Execution Frequency: Specify the number of times the USF should be executed during the benchmark to account for variability in short-term performance.

### Measurement Metrics

+ SCI: Tool?
+ Energy Consumption (kWh): Measure the total energy consumed during the benchmark using precise energy monitoring tools (e.g., Kepler, or direct power measurement at the hardware level).
+ Carbon Emission (CO2e): Calculate the carbon emissions based on the energy consumption data, using region-specific carbon intensity factors for electricity (e.g., grams of CO2e per kWh).
Test Methodology:

### Setup Instructions
+ Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for setting up the software and test environment, including installation scripts and configuration files.
+ Execution Procedure: Outline a sequential list of actions to perform during the benchmark, ensuring that each step is repeatable and documented.
+ Result Collection: Use automated logging tools to collect performance data (e.g., energy consumption, processing time). Ensure data integrity by validating logs against expected outputs.
Certification and Reporting:

+ SCER (Software Carbon Efficiency Rating): Assign a carbon efficiency rating based on the measured CO2e per USF, normalized to account for any variations in hardware performance.
+ Certification Levels: Define certification levels (e.g., Platinum, Gold, Silver) based on SCER thresholds, providing a clear and intuitive indication of software carbon efficiency.
+ Transparency and Reproducibility: All benchmark results, methodologies, and environmental configurations should be published openly to allow independent verification and reproducibility of results by third parties.
