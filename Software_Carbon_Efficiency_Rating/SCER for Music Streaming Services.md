# SCER Specification for Music Streaming Services

## Version 0.1

### Abstract

This Software Carbon Efficiency Rating (SCER) specification for Music Streaming Services provides a standard for assessing and rating the carbon efficiency of digital music streaming platforms. The aim is to quantify the environmental impact of these services and promote the reduction of carbon emissions through more efficient streaming technologies and practices.

### 1. Introduction

Music Streaming Services are at the forefront of the digital entertainment industry. With millions of active users, the energy demand and carbon footprint of these services are significant. Addressing their environmental impact is crucial in the fight against climate change.

### 2. Objective

To create an industry-wide SCER standard for Music Streaming Services that measures and encourages the reduction of carbon emissions through energy-efficient streaming technology and infrastructure.

### 3. Terminology

- **SCER**: Software Carbon Efficiency Rating
- **Stream/Watt**: Number of music streams or hours of music played per watt of power consumed.
- **Data Transfer Efficiency**: The efficiency of data transfer, measured as data transmitted per unit of energy.
- **Carbon Footprint**: Total amount of CO2e emissions directly and indirectly associated with the music streaming service.

### 4. Scope

This standard applies to all digital music streaming services, including both subscription-based and ad-supported platforms.

### 5. Software Categorization

Music streaming services will be categorized based on:

- User base size: small, medium, large
- Catalog size: number of songs available
- Streaming quality: standard, high, lossless

### 6. Benchmarking

Benchmarking will focus on:

- **Stream/Watt**: The number of streams or hours of music played per watt of power consumed.
- **Data Transfer Efficiency**: Data transmitted in relation to the energy consumed.
- **User Engagement**: Average listening time per user with energy consumption factored in.

### 7. Rating System

The SCER will be classified into three main categories:

- **A**: Highly efficient (>X Stream/Watt), high data transfer efficiency, and optimal user engagement.
- **B**: Moderately efficient ([Y-X] Stream/Watt), moderate data transfer efficiency, and user engagement.
- **C**: Less efficient (<Y Stream/Watt), lower data transfer efficiency, and user engagement.

### 8. Rating Calculation Algorithm

#### 8.1 Data Collection
Measure the Stream/Watt, data transfer efficiency, and user engagement.

#### 8.2 Normalization
Normalize the data against a baseline to ensure fair comparison across different services and qualities.

#### 8.3 Composite Score
Create a composite score from the normalized metrics.

#### 8.4 Rating Assignment
Calculate the percentile rank using the formula:

Percentile Rank is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Percentile Rank} = \left( \frac{\text{Music Streaming Service Rank} - 1}{\text{Total Submissions} - 1} \right) \times 100
$$




Then assign a SCER based on the percentile:

- Above 90%: **A**
- 60% to 90%: **B**
- Below 60%: **C**

### 9. Compliance and Verification

Compliance will be verified by an independent regulatory body through regular audits and reviews of the music streaming services' operational data.

### 10. Future Directions

The SCER for Music Streaming Services will be reviewed periodically, taking into account emerging technologies, user behavior patterns, and international standards for carbon efficiency.

By adhering to this SCER specification, music streaming services can benchmark and improve their carbon efficiency, leading to a more sustainable digital music industry.
