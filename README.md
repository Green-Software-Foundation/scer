## Software Carbon Efficiency Rating
- [Current baseline](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/scer)
- [Issues under review](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/scer/issues)

## Scope and Objectives
* Software Carbon Efficiency Rating (SCER) Standard: Develop a standardized software carbon efficiency rating system that can assess and rate the carbon efficiency of software products. This standard will provide a framework for evaluating and comparing the environmental impact of different software applications through the inclusion of a benchmark and a rating algorithm that can be used for decision-making around software applications' carbon efficiency. 
* Creating a Green Software Certification Lab (GSCL), a standardized testing and certification lab for green software, similar to UL (Underwriters Laboratories) for hardware and electrical systems, involves defining specific criteria, processes, and requirements to evaluate and certify the environmental sustainability and efficiency of software applications. Here is a set of specifications for the lab: Certification Framework, Energy Efficiency, Environmental Impact, Resource Optimization, Power Efficiency, Green Data Management, Renewable Energy Compatibility, Sustainable Development Practices, Certification Levels, etc.
* Documentation and Guidelines: Create comprehensive documentation and guidelines that detail the carbon-efficient software development process and the SCER rating system. 

## Deliverables:
* Software Carbon Efficiency Rating (SCER) Standard: Development and publication of a standardized SCER system that can assess and rate the carbon efficiency of software products.
* Green Software Certification Lab (GSCL): Detailed specification of the lab so that organizations can implement their labs based on the specification.
* Documentation and Guidelines: Comprehensive documentation and guidelines on the use of the SCER standard are available as reference materials for the community.
* Community Engagement Initiatives: Initiatives to engage the broader software development and environmental communities, such as webinars, forums, and collaborative projects.
